      <h2>Together ... How does it Work?</h2>
      <p>
        Together is software that is intended to support the practice of
        Circling, in all its different forms. Use the top links to find out more
        about installation. This section tells you exactly what Together does.
        The "Why" link in each section will tell you more about why we did it
        the way we did.

        <p>Whenever you start Together you will first find yourself in the
          Gathering. Everyone else in Together at this time shows up in the People
          list on the left. You can see what Circles are in progress and who is in
          them. You can text chat with people or invite them to a voice call.</p>

        <p>At the upper left corner of The gathering you will see a golden symbol.
          Clicking on this brings up a central menu that shows all other available
          features.</p>

        <p>At the upper right corner of The gathering you will see your name. You
          can click on your name to go to the Welcome screen. Here you can change
          your Personal Key or change your avatar.</p>

      <p>
        If Together can be imagined as a Circling immersion led by everyone present, then
        a Circle is like a room where you shut the door but do not lock it. The person
        who creates a Circle is the one who can say what kind of container it is and
        invite people into it. People who want to join the Circle will look at its name
        and who else is in it. They might know they are welcome there, or they might
        send a chat message to ask whether it's a good time to join.

    <div class="join-explained">

      <p>To
        create a new Circle, give it a name and join it. If you wish to allow
        people to join without turning on a camera, click the Allow
        audio-only box. When you join the Circle, you will find yourself
        in a new screen where everyone in the Circle can see and hear
        everyone else.</p>
      <p>
        Each Circle in progress shows up in the People list and the people
        in the Circle show up under it. No other information can be seen about
        these people. Everything that happens inside a Circle is private to that
        Circle.</p>
      <p>To join a Circle, you select it in the People list, then click Join.</p>

      <p>Circle mode: The video images are arranged in a 3D circle. This
        becomes more obvious when there are more than 3 people in a Circle. In
        Circle view some images are unobstructed and some are partially
        obstructed, just as when people are sitting in a circle in a room. You can
        set focus on a particular image by clicking on it. Or you can hit the
        Enter button to start the whole Circle slowly rotating. The Backspace button
        causes the Circle to return to its home position. Other controls are
        listed in the Key Bindings menu. This view is the one that will be most
        compatible with planned future features of Together.</p>

      <img src="images/focus-mode.png" />

      <p>Focus mode: The selected video image fills the entire screen. All of
        the images are shown in a circle of miniature widgets at the bottom of the
        screen. Clicking on any of these miniature widget causes that image to be
        selected.</p>

      <img src="images/gallery-mode.png" />

      <p>Gallery mode: All of the video images are arranged in equal-sized
        squares on the screen. This view is similar to what is offered in software
        that supports business meetings.</p>

      <img src="images/main-menu.png" <p> Show a central menu of all the other possible options. One of the
      menu items is a list of Key Bindings, which offers more options. Audio and Video Options are other
      menu items.</p>

      <p>Quality: The current quality of your video image is shown in the upper right corner
         of the Circle screen. It can be Low, Medium, or Standard.
        This video quality limits the amount of video data you send and receive.
        Together will set the upper limit of video quality based on the speed of
        your computer and internet connection. You can use Video Options to
        reduce the quality further.
        You might do this if you notice your computer struggling as many people
        join the Circle.</p>
        <p>Camera: This displays a drop-down list of all cameras that Together is able to detect.
           If you want to switch between your built-in laptop camera and an external camera, for example,
           then select it from this list.</p>
           <p>Use Retina: This option only applies to Mac computers with Retina capability, which causes text to
           be displayed at higher resolution and look sharper. If your computer has
           this capability then you can turn it on or off.</p>

     <p>Microphone: This displays a drop-down list of all microphones that Together is able to detect. 
        Use it to switch between a built-in microphone and the microphone from a headset.</p>

     <p>Push to talk: This feature keeps your microphone muted unless your spacebar is pressed. So you push
        down the spacebar to talk and release it when you are not talking. It's a useful feature if your
        computer is echoing the voices of others on the call.</p>

     <p>Aggressive Denoising: Denoising is a feature that filters out background noise from the sound that
        your microphone picks up. Together always provides a small level of denoising, but if you have
        a loud computer fan or background noises, then others on the call may still hear them. Turn on
        Aggressive Denoising if people tell you that they can hear noise from you when you are not speaking.</p>
     <p>Speaker: This displays a drop-down list of all speakers that Together is able to detect. Use it to switch
        between a built-in speaker and headphones.</p>

      </div>
      <p>Chat is available in The gathering and in a Circle. The
        main window shows a scrollable record of all the chat messages that you
        have seen in this Together session. Below that is a small text entry
        window where you can type a message to send to others. By clicking on
        someone in People you can send a private message to that person. By
        clicking on The gathering you can send a message to everyone who is
        currently in The gathering. When you are in a Circle, you can click on the
        name of the Circle at the top of your screen to send a message to everyone
        in the Circle. Or you can send to The gathering or to an individual. You
        will always see where you are sending the current chat message from the
        To: message over the text entry window. Take a look at Key Bindings to see
        more Chat options.</p>

        <a href="../why/why.html#streams">Why</a>
      </div>
      <p>When you are in a Circle, you can stream a video or
        audio file from your computer to the others in the Circle. You can also
        display a still picture. Each of these will show up as a new image that
        forms part of the Circle. Together supports various audio and video
        formats. To stream a file, put it in the
        Documents/Together/prod/Streams folder of your computer. Then invoke
        Stream Convert, which causes Together to convert it to a format it can
        use. Stream Convert will process all of the files in the Streams folder
        that have not already been converted. You can repeat it any time you add
        new files to that folder.</p>

      <p>To play a video or audio file for everyone in your Circle, invoke
        Stream. You will see a list of all converted files. Click on the one you
        want to play in the list and it will start playing as a separate image in
        the Circle. It will also show as playing in the list. Click on a playing
        stream to make it stop.</p>
