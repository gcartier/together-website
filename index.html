      <p class="text"> Together is software that is intended to support the practice of
        Circling, in all its different forms. Use the top links to find out more
        about installation. This section tells you exactly what Together does.

      <div class="title"><a class="a-black" href="why/why.html">Why it is</a></div>

      <p class="text"> Guillaume and I created Together from our desire for community with others
        who practice Circling. We also wanted to create something amazing that only we,
        with our unique lifetimes of skills and experience, could create. And we really
        wanted to grow ourselves by stepping into the adventure of doing all this
        together. </p>

    <div class="who-we-are">
      <div class="title"><a class="a-black" href="who/who.html">Who we are</a></div>
      <p class="text"> We are Guillaume and Barbara,
        two software developers who practice Circling. For the past 10 years, Guillaume
        has been working with his own computer language to create an application that he
        envisioned would be used for gaming and teaching. Since we met in person, I
        (Barbara) have been working with him to expand it for Circling. </p>
