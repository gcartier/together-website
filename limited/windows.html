      <h1>Installing Together on Windows</h1>

      <img src="images/launcher_cut.png" alt="Together" class="image" />

      <p class="p">Welcome to the Windows install page for Together.
Here is the link to the file that will install Together on your Windows computer:
<span class="link"><a class="c3" href="Together Setup.exe">Together Setup</a></span></p>


      <p class="p">Together supports Windows 7 and later.</p>

      <p class="p">For the Mac, go <span class="link"><a href="mac.html">here</a></span></p>

      <p class="p">For Linux, go <span class="link"><a href="linux.html">here</a></span></p>

      <p class="p">Together does not currently have a version for Chromebook, Android, or iOS (iPhone/iPad).</p>

      <h3 class="h3">Short Version</h3>

      <p class="p">Download the setup file linked at the top of this page. This file is small and will download quickly. When you double-click on it, a setup program will start that downloads and installs the Together launcher. If you feel
        comfortable without further instructions,
        then you don&#146;t need to read the long version. In that case, some key things you need to know are:</p>
      <ul list-style-position:outside;>
        <div class="list">
          <li class="item"> You will encounter warnings that Together is not from a certified source. For
                            our take on that, see <span class="link"><a href="#windows-warning">here</a></span>.
          <li class="item"> The Together launcher starts from the green icon and shows a desert oasis.
          <li class="item"> The launcher will always update Together when it starts.
          <li class="item"> The antivirus application(s) on your computer might make the first time install very slow. If it seems like nothing is happening, please wait 5 minutes before giving up.
        </div>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="h3">Long Version</h3>
      <p class="p">These instructions apply specifically to PC computers running Windows 10. Earlier versions of Windows will not show the Windows Defender warnings below.</p>


      <p class="p">When you clicked on the Together Setup link at the top of this page, your web browser downloaded it. You can see it at the bottom of your browser window or find it in your Downloads directory. Double-click on Together Setup.exe to
        run it. Windows Defender
        will pop up up the following warning:</p>
     <img id="windows-warning" src="images/defender_more.png" alt="Windows Defender tells you it saved your computer" class="image" ; />

      <p class="p">This happens because we have not signed our software with an official code-signing authority. Code-signing is a way for you to know that a company is who they claim to be. We, the creators of Together, are not a company and we have no way to register with such an authority. If you use Windows and you
install software, then you have to decide for yourself whether to proceed. It's like: I cannot tell you
to disregard the warnings that Windows gives you for your safety because software from an unknown source
can be dangerous. At the same time, I know that our software is not dangerous. If you choose to proceed,
then follow the instructions below.</p>


      <p class="p">Click on <u>More info</u> and you will see this window allowing you to proceed with the install:</p>

      <img src="images/defender_run.png" alt="Windows Defender displays a Run button that allows you to proceed" class="image" ; />


      <p class="p">Click on Run anyway and the Together installation will begin:</p>

      <img src="images/script_welcome.png" alt="Installer Welcome Screen" class="image" ; />

      <p class="p">When you click Next, you will see a screen that allows you to change the directory where Together will be installed on your computer. It&#146;s best if you leave it where it is. Note that you can move the entire Together directory
        wherever you like after the install.</p>

      <img src="images/script_install.png" alt="Screen showing where Together will be installed" class="image" ; />


      <p class="p">Then you will see the final install screen:</p>

      <img src="images/script_finish.png" alt="Screen showing installation in progress" class="image" ; />

      <p class="p">When you click Finish, Together Setup will contact our server to download Together proper which is quite large. Depending on your antivirus, various dialogs might pop up before this happens. Some of them disappear with no
        explanation and allow the next step to proceed. If you see the following one, then check that your internet connection is working by bringing something up in a web browser:</p>

      <img src="images/no_internet.png" alt="Error message saying cannot connect to Server" class="image" ; />

      <p class="p">Once you have verified that you have a working internet, click OK.</p>

      <p class="p">Together will show its launcher with a red bar indicating the progress of the update. This update can take a long time the first time because it is downloading everything that you need to run Together. Next time Together will
        download only the things that have changed, which will happen quickly.</p>

      <img src="images/launcher_loading.png" alt="Together Launcher loading" class="image" ; />

      <p class="p">When the update is finished, the Welcome screen will appear. This screen asks you to enter your invitation word. This is a word you were
given when you were invited to Together. You must also enter your name. This is
the name that will be displayed to other people in Together, so it should be
the real name you want people to call you:</p>

      <img src="images/welcome_screen_inv.png" alt="Welcome Screen" class="image" ; />
      <p class="p">If your invitation is valid, Together will generate for you
a Personal Key. This is private to you and will be automatically loaded next
time you start Together.</p>

      <img src="images/welcome_screen_key.png" alt="Welcome Screen" class="image" ; />
      <p class="p">Now Together is fully installed. Press Enter to go to
      The gathering, where someone can
      verify that you are a person they know:
      <img src="images/gathering_unverified.png" alt="The gathering before verification" class="image" ; />
 Poke around and have fun, or read
        about it <a href="../index.html">here</a>.</p>
      <p class="p">From now on you will always launch Together by clicking the green icon. We suggest you drag it to your dock for quick access:</p>

      <img src="images/green_icon.png" alt="Green Icon for launching Together" class="image" />

      <p class="p">While Together is running, it will show up as a blue icon on your toolbar:</p>

      <img src="images/blue_icon.png" alt="Blue Icon for running Together" class="image" />
      <h3 class="h3">Troubleshooting</h3>

      <p class="p">Some antivirus applications have to be turned off during the initial install. Below is a message from Avast (free version) when I tried to start Together Setup.exe:</p>

      <img src="images/avast_warning.png" alt="Avast not allowing Together Setup to run" class="image" ; />

      <p class="p">If something like this comes up, deactivate your antivirus application while you install Together for the first time. When you reach the name entry screen, quit Together and then reactivate your antivirus application. Let me repeat
        that. Turn your antivirus protection back on so that it keeps protecting your computer. Then launch Together from the green icon:</p>

      <img src="images/green_icon.png" alt="Green Icon for launching Together" class="image" />

      <p class="p">Note that the first time you start Together with the antivirus activated it will take up to 5 minutes to load the name entry screen. From then on it will load immediately. There will be no further need to deactivate your antivirus
        application.</p>
