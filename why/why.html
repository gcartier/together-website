      <h2>Together ... Why is it?</h2>
      <p>
      <p>Guillaume and I created Together from our desire for community with
         others who practice Circling. We also wanted to create something
         amazing that only we, with our unique lifetimes of skills and
         experience, could create. And we really wanted to grow ourselves
         by stepping into the adventure of doing all this together.
      </p>

      <p>People do a lot of Circling on-line these days, using excellent software that was
         created mainly for business meetings. Together is the very best design we can
         currently imagine for Circling.
         Some of the attributes that make it good for Circling are:
      <ul>
        <li style="padding-bottom:5px">We are not separated from one another. We know who else is in the world of Together right now.
        <li style="padding-bottom:5px">We see and hear one another. You only get to join a Circle if you have a camera and microphone turned on. (Unless the Circle was created with
            "Allow audio-only" checked.)
        <li style="padding-bottom:5px">We occupy physical space in the virtual world.
        <li style="padding-bottom:5px">We use our social skill instead of software enforcement to navigate the world of connection.
        <li style="padding-bottom:5px">The software can be changed to do new things when we want it to.
      </ul>
      <p>We can only know whether these attributes make a difference when we
         have tried it out. That is where we step into the unknowable
         adventure of inviting others to share the world of Together.
         Each section that follows has a "How" link that explains exactly
         how that part of Together works.

        <a href="../how/how.html#the-gathering">How</a>
      </div>

      <p>The gathering is designed for a community of people to notice
        one another's presence. Seeing who else is there and what Circles
        are in progress gives a sense of aliveness, perhaps even connection.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="circle-intro">

        <a href="../how/how.html#circle">How</a>
      </div>

      <p>There is no firm intent for what a Circle should be like.
        The person who created it can set the intent, and we hope
        that this will be where we begin to explore what is possible
        in on-line interaction.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="join-explained">

      <p>At first we held the belief that all Circles should require
        people to have their camera and microphone on, or at least able
        to turn on. Then we started using Together ourselves for talking
        while playing a multiplayer video game and realized that we need to
        be able to use it without video. So we added the "allow audio-only"
        checkbox.</p>
      <p> There is currently no provision to lock a Circle or to restrict
        access. If we were at a Circling event, people would be off Circling
        in different rooms that would not be locked, so why should this be
        different? In practice, it may be necessary to add software support
        for locking Circles so that people don't have to deal with the
        uncertainty of whether they should join or not. This is a feature
        that we would like to design with input from people who are
        actively using Together so we can see what is really needed.

      <p>We love the icons of Together because they are beautiful. They do not
        resemble their functions in most cases, although we made some
        effort to find a relationship. Traditionally icons show (ugly?) little pictures
        of the thing they do, such as turn on microphone, or display chat window.
        We decided to use icons that you might
        come to recognize over time and that we enjoy seeing in the space.</p>

      <p>Circle mode is unlike anything seen in typical video-conference software.
        It begins our exploration of how it is to Circle in a 3D world. As the Circle
        gets larger you cannot see everyone at once, so you have to rotate or
        change perspective in some way to look at the person who has your attention. This
        is more like the real world experience of sitting in a circle of people, where
        you turn your head to see people in various places.
      </p>

      <img src="../how/images/focus-mode.png" />

      <p>Focus mode allows a single person or image to fill your screen.
      </p>

      <img src="../how/images/gallery-mode.png" />

      <p>Gallery mode puts everyone into an equal-sized rectangle.
        This is an efficient way of seeing everyone at once and also feels
        chaotic when there are more than two or three people there. Perhaps
        we are not wired to put our focus equally on everyone all the time.

      <p> People view gives us information about who else is there are what they
        are doing. It's a tie to the sense that this Circle I am in right now
        is part of a larger community.</p>

      <img src="../how/images/chat.png" />
      <p> Chat view gives us a way to whisper privately or to announce something
        publicly without breaking into what is happening now.</p>

      </div>
      <p>
        We want people to have the best quality of video that their computer and internet
        connection can handle. There could come a time when the software can change the
        quality setting as it notices that your computer is struggling or your internet
        is not delivering everthing. But for now you have to make the change yourself.

      <p>
        Your Audio options are mainly there to reduce or eliminate the extra noises that
        others in the call might hear from your computer. If your computer fan is making
        noise, then you might not notice it but others will. Aggressive Denoising will
        stop that noise or other noises such as the background clatter of a coffee shop.
        If other people in the call can hear their own voices echo through
        your microphone, then you will not know that is happening unless they tell you.
        If that happens more than occasionally, then either wear headphones or use Push to talk.

        I like using text chat to greet someone or ask them to join a Circle with me.
        I also use it
        to find out whether it's a good time for me to join a Circle. In a Circle,
        I might use it to speak privately to someone.

      <p>Guillaume and I use this feature to play music and videos that keep
        us inspired. We have been also been using it to display pictures of
        people so that we can see what it looks like to have more people in the
        Circle.
        You could use this feature to play some music or a video to set
        the mood for a Circle. You can also use it to display an image
        that you want to share.
